WARNING! You have to set the `client_id` and `client_secret` environment variables which are the two required keys in order to fetch the images from the Imgur API. 

The project is configured to Autocreate scemes but in case there are no scemes set when you first open the project, go to `Manage Schemes...` then click on `Autocreate Schemes Now`.
